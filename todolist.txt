📅 Daily To-Do List (March 4, 2025)
✅ Top 3 Priorities
Finish that annoying assignment I’ve been putting off.
Hit the gym or at least stretch a little.
Call/text a friend or family member—been too caught up lately.
📝 Life & Work Stuff
Go to class (or at least watch the lecture recording if I miss it).
Reply to emails/messages I’ve been ignoring for days.
Get some GitHub commits in—no zero days!
Sort out my notes for the upcoming exam.
🏡 Personal & Self-Care
Drink more water (seriously, no more surviving on coffee).
Clean up my desk—it’s starting to look like a crime scene.
Take a break without feeling guilty (watch an episode of something or play a game).
🍽 Food & Errands
Actually eat a proper meal, not just snacks.
Buy groceries or at least check if I have food left.
Do laundry (if I have any clean clothes left, maybe skip this).

📅 Daily To-Do List (March 4, 2025)
✅ Top 3 Priorities
Try hitting a new PR on the bench press.
Buy a gift for the upcoming birthday of your sister!
Don't forget to call your parents to congratulate them on their anniversary!
📝 Life & Work Stuff
Stop being lazy and go to class.
Reply to emails/messages I’ve been ignoring for days.
Get some GitHub commits in—no zero days!
Sort out my notes for the upcoming exam.
🏡 Personal & Self-Care
Drink more water (seriously, no more surviving on coffee).
Clean up my desk—it’s starting to look like a crime scene.
Take a break without feeling guilty (watch an episode of something or play a game).
🍽 Food & Errands
Actually eat a proper meal, not just snacks.
Buy groceries or at least check if I have food left.
Do laundry (if I have any clean clothes left, maybe skip this).
